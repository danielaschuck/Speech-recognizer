# Speech Recognition in Python

This is a simple Python project that uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform real-time speech recognition using a microphone connected to the computer.

## How to use

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Install the SpeechRecognition library by running the command `pip install SpeechRecognition` in your terminal.
3. Run the `speech_recognition.py` file in the terminal using the command `python speech_recognition.py`.
4. Speak into your computer's microphone when prompted. The program will transcribe your audio into text.

## Notes

- Make sure that your microphone is connected and configured correctly before running the program.
- You can change the language used in the speech recognition by modifying the `language` parameter on line 6 of the `speech_recognition.py` file. For example, `language="pt-BR"` for Brazilian Portuguese or `language="en-US"` for American English.
- This project is just a simple demonstration of using the SpeechRecognition library in Python and should not be used for productive or critical purposes.
